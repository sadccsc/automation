# each line have to have entries in the following sequence: dataset,datatype,domain,basetime,index,indextype,climfirstyear,climlastyear,overwrite
# there must be no spaces

# each line have to have entries in the following sequence: 
# dataset,datatype,domain,variable,basetime,index,indextime,indextype,climatologyfirstyear,climatologylastyear,percentmissing,overwrite
# 
# drought indices are calculated on monthly data, thus basetime will always be mon, and variable will be PRCPTOT (as this variable is calculated from daily data)
# allowed terms:
# variable: PRCPTOT 
# dataset: ARC2 TAMSAT-v3.1 CHIRPS-v2.0-p05 - these have to be rainfall datasets, for which monthly total is calculated
# domain: sadc sey com mau
# basetime: mon 
# index: SPI
# indextime: 1,3,6,12,36 - in fact any reasonable value should work...
# indextype: index - this simply calculates SPI. potentially duration or severity can be derived for different levels of SPI, but that would need to be implemented in the calc_drought.py first 
# fracmissing: 0
# overwrite: 0 or 1
