# this is the list of indices to be calculated using calcindices.py
# 
# each line have to have entries in the following sequence: variable,dataset,domain,basetime,index
# there must be no spaces
# lines commented with # and empty lines will be ignored

# allowed terms:

#
# not all combinations of dataset and domain are possible, as not all datasets cover all domains, and not all datasets have appropriate resolution for small domains

# not all combinations of basetime and index make sense. Suggested are:
