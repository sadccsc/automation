#this one calculates daily climatology of TX95 over the climatological period. 
#these calculations are different than the standard ETCCDI index in that the percentile is calculated
# for data from 15-day window centered on a particular day of year
# this command has to be run only once, ie. it does not have to be run in the monitoring setting
# it has to be re-run, though, if one changes the climatological period
